# Lighthouse-style Audit Rules

- Evaluate the current HTML/CSS/JS for:
  - Performance bottlenecks (render-blocking resources, large payloads).
  - Accessibility issues (missing alt text, label associations, color contrast).
  - Best practices (meta tags, responsive viewport).
- Suggest or apply improvements to improve:
  - Performance score.
  - Accessibility score.
  - SEO fundamentals.
- Add audit summary as a comment or Markdown block if needed.
