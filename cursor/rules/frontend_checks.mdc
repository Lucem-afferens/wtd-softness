# Frontend Code Quality Rules

- After modifying a file, validate:
  - HTML syntax and structure (via W3C validator-style logic).
  - CSS syntax, specificity, and performance.
  - JavaScript for unused code, syntax errors, bad practices.
- Always lint JS (use ESLint rules where relevant).
- If problems or inefficiencies are found, correct them automatically.
- Always avoid breaking the existing logic.
- Ensure all visual or interactive features continue working after changes.
- Suggest and apply improvements where possible.
